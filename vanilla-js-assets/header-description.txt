I have been working in Global visual effects (VFX) companies for over 10 years, VFX is closely related to programming, and I have always used bits of code to automate mundane everyday tasks. Writing scripts became my favourite part of my work, and I decided to study Java, Python and C#. Quick learner, patience, responsibility and Procedural approach are
the qualities that I have developed over the years of work and studies.
